# Verifiable Data Storage with RISC Zero and Merkle Tree

## Overview

This project aims to create a verifiable data storage system where data integrity can be proven using zero-knowledge proofs (RISC Zero) and Merkle trees.

## Components

- Data Storage: A simple key-value store.
- Merkle Tree: To ensure data integrity.
- RISC Zero: To generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs.
